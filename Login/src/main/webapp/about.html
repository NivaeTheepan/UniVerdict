                            At <b>UniVerdict</b>, we recognize that university life can be
                            both exhilarating and daunting. As students navigate their
                            academic paths, they often encounter challenges that leave them
                            feeling unprepared for the rigorous coursework. That's where we
                            step in. At UniVerdict we bridge the gap between students and
                            their course experiences. We've created website specifically for
                            Computer Engineering students at Toronto Metropolitan University.
                            Here's what we have to offer:

                                    <b>Course Ratings and Reviews</b>: UniVerdict allows students
                                    from various years to provide ratings and share candid
                                    comments about their courses. Whether it's an introductory
                                    programming class or an advanced algorithms course, our
                                    platform lets you learn from your peers' experiences.

                                    <b>Professor Insights</b>: While other platforms focus on
                                    professor ratings, we believe that understanding the course
                                    itself is equally crucial. Our website fills the void by
                                    emphasizing course-specific information. After all, a great
                                    professor can't compensate for a poorly designed curriculum.
