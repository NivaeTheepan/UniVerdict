# UniVerdict
This web application was created in order to gain a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, SQL, and Java (specifically how JSP and JavaServlets work). The project adopts the microservices architecture, as seen by the separated folders which represent the core features of the web app. UniVerdict was created as a tool that could be used by 1st-3rd year Computer Engineering students attending Toronto Metropolitan University, to gain valuable information on their upcoming courses. Without signing up for an account, students can read posted reviews on courses by other students however, upon creating an account for themselves, they would gain access to a new page on UniVerdict where they can add their own course reviews.
