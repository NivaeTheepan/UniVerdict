# UniVerdict
This web application was created in order to gain a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, SQL, and Java (specifically how JSP and JavaServlets work). The project initially started out as a monolithic web application but it then shifted to adopt the microservices architecture, as seen by the separated folders which represent the core features of the web app. UniVerdict was created as a tool that could be used by 1st-3rd year Computer Engineering students attending Toronto Metropolitan University, to gain valuable information on their upcoming courses and what they should do to prepare themselves for these courses better. Without signing up for an account, students are able to read posted reviews on courses by other students however, upon creating an account for themselves, they would gain access to a new page on UniVerdict where they can add their own course reviews. Feel free to open each feature's respective folder to see what the web pages associated with that feature look like.
